#Basic if-else questions:
#Write a python program that checks if a number is positive/negative/zero.

elif a>0:
        print(a,":value is positive")

        print(a,":value is negative")
else:

#Write a program that checks wheather a given number is even/odd.
b=int(input("enter b value:"))
if b%2==0:
      print(b,":value is even")
elif b%1==0:
      print(b,":value is odd")
else:

# Write a program that asks the user to enter marks and assigns grades as follows:

# Write a Python program that takes a temperature input in Celsius and categorizes it as:
