<body bgcolor="Sapphire">
    The sky paints dreams in shades of gold<br/>
    Soft winds carry secrets untold.<br/>
    A river hums its gentle song,<br/>
    Inviting weary hearts along.<br/>
    <hr>
    The stars awaken, shy and bright,<br/>
Guardians of the velvet night.<br/>
Each leaf becomes a page of lore,<br/>
A story flowing evermore.<br/>
<hr>
In silence, beauty finds its place,<br/>
The world a poem, full of grace.<br/>
